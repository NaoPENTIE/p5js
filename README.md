# p5js Demo
  My Experiments with p5js using simplex noise on 3d grids and matrix systems.
  You can change the render file called in index.js, each variation are experiments
  in rendering and shader functions.

  CbeRender - 3D Cub system, improving rendering and optimizations.

  MtxRender - 3D Cube system, higher resolution settings can cause a slow down.
  ZrtRender - Grid system, block render method and opacity shaders.

  AltRender - Grid system using dat-gui to control display settings.
  Render - Original Render, initial framework with basic interaction.

## Change Log
  * Mouse Down and Drag - to prevent constant movement.
  * AltRender.js - updated render functions.
  * Change Object sphere / box
  * Better Shader Formulas.
  * Mouse rotation and Wheel Zoom.
  * Running on p5js - needing to update render.
  * Initial Commit - Basic formula added for simplexNoise.

## Run the example
  Requires Node v7.0.0 or greater

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run dev & open http://localhost:8080
```
